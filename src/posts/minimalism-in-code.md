# Minimalism in Code

Software engineering often feels like a race to add features. We build, we ship, we iterate. But in the process, we accumulate debt. Not just technical debt, but *cognitive* debt.

## The Cost of Complexity

Every line of code you write is a liability. It must be read, understood, tested, and maintained. The more code you have, the harder it is to change.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## Strategies for Reduction

1. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Don't build features for a hypothetical future.
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstraction is good, but premature abstraction is the root of all evil.
3. **Delete Code:** Celebrate deleting code as much as writing it.

## Conclusion

Strive for elegance. Simple code is robust code.
